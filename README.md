# ETL Command Line Interface

ETL CLI is a command line client that works with ETL server by exposing various user friendly arguments/parameters and simplifies ETL operations. It works with ETL RESTful endpoints and prepares a payload based on user inputed arguments. It hides lots of verbosity and exposes common patterns and shortcuts. Used as standalone terminal command or can be used as a library to build any other python client.
